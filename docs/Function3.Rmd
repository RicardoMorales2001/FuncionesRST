# ***3rd function: correlation function***

### Description

Explanation and description

The my_corr_plot function is a function in R that generates a scatterplot and calculates the correlation between two numeric variables in a dataframe. The function takes three arguments: the dataframe data, and the names of the two numeric variables x_var and y_var.

The function starts with three checks. The first checks that the data argument is a dataframe; if it is not, execution is halted and an error message is displayed indicating that data must be a dataframe. The next two checks verify that x_var and y_var are column names in data; if any of them does not exist, the execution is stopped and an error message is displayed indicating the name of the column that does not exist.

After the checks, the function calculates the correlation between the two numeric variables using the cor function. Next, create a scatterplot using ggplot with the two numeric variables specified in x_var and y_var. The chart title includes the correlation rounded to two decimal places. Finally, the function prints the graph and returns the value of the calculated correlation.

### Example

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("FuncionesRST")
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(3, 5, 4, 6, 7)
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
my_corr_plot(df, "x", "y")
```
